# fleet-tracker #
A school project for Software Development II (Capstone).  An Android fleet tracking software that connects to an in car OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) system and tracks metrics, such as, speed, RPMs, and temperatures.  This will be paired with location and accelerometer data from the phone and will aggregate to a map that will show points of hard acceleration, braking, and turning.
